# Shengwang Integration

## Routing Rules

### Step 0: Ensure doc index exists

Before doing anything else, check if `references/docs.txt` exists.
If not, download it:
```bash
bash skills/shengwang-integration/scripts/fetch-docs.sh
```
This file is the documentation index — all doc lookups depend on it.
If download fails, proceed with local reference docs and fallback URLs.

### Step 1: Check if intake can be skipped

Skip [intake](intake/README.md) and route directly ONLY when ALL of these are true:
- User names a specific operation (e.g. "stop agent xxx", "generate a token", "download SDK")
- User provides enough technical details to act immediately (channel name, agent ID, language, etc.)
- The request maps unambiguously to exactly one module in the table below

Examples that SKIP intake:
- "帮我停掉 agent_abc123" → [conversational-ai](references/conversational-ai/README.md)
- "生成一个 RTC token，Go 语言" → [token-server](references/token-server/README.md)
- "error 403 是什么意思" → [conversational-ai/troubleshooting](references/conversational-ai/common-errors.md)
- "下载 ConvoAI Go SDK" → route to the relevant product module (each has Demo Projects / download links)

Examples that MUST go through intake:
- "我想做一个 AI 客服" → needs analysis, go to intake
- "帮我接入 ConvoAI" → product identified but details missing, go to intake
- "我想做视频通话 + AI 助手" → multi-product, go to intake
- "voice bot" / "AI agent" → vague, go to intake

### Step 2: Route

| User intent | Route to |
|-------------|----------|
| New request, vague, or missing details | [intake](intake/README.md) |
| Credentials, AppID, REST auth | [general](references/general/credentials-and-auth.md) |
| Download SDK, sample project, Token Builder, GitHub repo | Route to the relevant product module |
| Generate Token, token server, AccessToken2, RTC/RTM auth | [token-server](references/token-server/README.md) |
| ConvoAI operation (with details already known) | [conversational-ai](references/conversational-ai/README.md) |
| RTC SDK integration | [rtc](references/rtc/README.md) |
| RTM messaging / signaling | [rtm](references/rtm/README.md) |
| Cloud Recording | [cloud-recording](references/cloud-recording/README.md) |

## Download Rules

- Use `git clone --depth 1 <url>` — GitHub URLs must be repo root only (no branch/subdirectory paths)
- On any download failure: report the error, provide the URL for manual download, never silently skip
